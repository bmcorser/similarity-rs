"Request for proposals for globel logistics service providers to design, build, operate, maintain and eventually hand over its proposed inland container terminal in Tambo Springs, South Africa","South Africa’s freight and logistics company Transnet this week launched its massive drive to bring private sector operators into the country’s freight system. The company has issued a request for proposals inviting suitably qualified global logistics service providers to design, build, operate, maintain and eventually hand over its proposed inland container terminal in Tambo Springs, East of Johannesburg. The concession will be over a 20 year period and will be Transnet's biggest private sector participation project to date.
The proposed terminal is in line with Transnet’s drive to migrate rail friendly cargo off the country’s road network.
The terminal is expected to be in operation by 2019 and will have an initial capacity of 144 000 TEUs per annum, with an option to ramp it up to 560 000 TEUs, depending on demand.
The project entails the following:
•	Arrival and departure yard for handling cargo trains
•	Terminal infrastructure;
•	Terminal equipment;
•	Stacking area;
•	Warehousing space
•	Distribution centre
•	Inland Reefer facilities
Transnet Freight Rail will be responsible for the operation of the arrival and departure yard required to service the terminal.
The operator will be responsible for loading and offloading of containers and marketing of the facility. The winning bidder is expected to introduce new entrants - particularly black players - must have demonstrated technical expertise, a minimum of level 4 BBBEE status with a commitment to reach level 2 by the third year of operation.
Transnet currently operates 5 inland terminals in Gauteng, including the City Deep Container Terminal in Johannesburg, Africa’s largest inland port.
The proposed terminal is an integral part of the Presidential Infrastructure Co-ordinating Committee’s SIP 2, aimed at unlocking the country’s industrial development while boosting export capability. It is designed to complement Transnet’s container-handling capacity in the province.
This is the culmination of years of hard work and a demonstration of cooperative governance between Transnet, representing the national competence, and both the Gauteng Provincial Government and the Ekurhuleni Municipality.
The Tambo Springs terminal is one of three mega terminals that Transnet is planning to build in Gauteng over the next 20 years. It will be located in Ekurhuleni along the N3, just off the Natal Corridor.
The project is expected to create 50 000 jobs, and has stringent requirements for supplier development and skills transfer.
Private sector participation is an important aspect of Transnet’s funding plan. The company has identified PSPs as one of the ways in which the company can broaden its sources of funding for capital investments and get access to private sector skills and expertise. 
Transnet has identified a number of projects that can be executed through Private Sector Partnerships (PSPs). These include:
•	Blue Train PSP with Sun International;
•	Supply Base Facility in Saldanha
•	Ship and Rig repair Facilities in Saldanha
•	Ship repair facilities in Richards Bay
•	Boat building and Ship repair facilities in East London
•	Refurbishment and upgrade of agricultural terminals
•	The Grootvlei coal loading facility in Mpumalanga;
•	Ceres Railway Line
•	Mmamatwane common user loading facility
Besides increasing inland container-handling capacity and encouraging migration to rail, the Tambo Springs partnership will help Transnet accelerate investment in logistics infrastructure, improve operational efficiencies and secure adequate commercial returns.
The deadline for submissions is 30 September 2016. Transnet expects to award the contract in the last quarter of the company’s financial year.  Please contact UKTI for any further information.",29/09/2016

Opportunities for waste management companies to provide waste-to-energy solutions in 7 Indonesian cities,"Management of waste is becoming a major problem in Indonesia. Early this year the Indonesian government issued Presidential Decree No. 18 of 2016 to accelerate the development of waste-to-energy in 7 cities, namely Jakarta, Tangerang, Bandung, Semarang, Surakarta, Surabaya, and Makassar. Currently Indonesia is facing difficulties in implementing PPP projects due to the complexity of tender process. However, this regulation provides a shortcut and allows the city mayors to directly appoint developers for waste-to-energy projects, creating immediate opportunities. To that end, the government seeks participation by companies providing waste-to-energy technologies besides incineration, such as gasification and pyrolysis. 
A minimum 1000 tonnes of waste per day will be processed, and the State Utility guarantees the purchase of electricity produced by the facility. Under the Waste Law, the government will finance waste management activities from the state/regional budget. In addition, Feed in Tariff for electricity generated from Municipal Waste is available at between US$ 18,77 to 22,43 cents per kiloWatt Hour.

"French consortia seeks supplier of canal lock mechanisms to partner in tender application to large-gauge inland waterway canal infrastructure project between France, Belgium and the Netherlands.","Background to the project
The future Seine-Nord Europe canal, which is located at the heart of the Seine-Scheldt network, stretches over 107 km. Linking the Oise river at Compiègne to the Dunkerque-Escaut canal at Cambrai, this large-gauge inland waterway links the North sea to the Mediterranean corridors providing a more effective multimodal link between the other transport modes, the seaports and inland ports of the North of France and of Europe.
With its 4 multimodal platforms and its 6 goods trans-shipment stocks, the Seine-Nord Europe canal will fill in the missing link of the Seine-Scheldt large-gauge inland waterway link and will open up the Seine basin by linking it to the 20,000 km of the large-gauge European inland waterway network. 
Its purpose is to remove the bottleneck which currently restricts the traffic to boats with a displacement of no more than 700 tonnes. The number of locks is also an obstacle to the expansion of inland waterway transport and the creation of a network of multimodal inland ports. 
The project is split into 4 sections, to break down the scope of the construction work. Each section will be managed by a Maitre d’Oeuvre. They will design and manage the works along their section. The total cost of the works is estimated at € 3.3 billion [Euros], exclusive of tax.

Material required is clean mixed waste glass in the range of 2-6 mm,"Silicon Fertilisers Pty Ltd has patents granted and in National Phase in many countries including the EU. The innovative process developed utilises post consumer waste glass to produce a potent silicon based plant nutrient material which greatly increases crop yields (and also confers other significant benefits to most crops). The product provides a high value add to a material that in most cases is normally disposed of to landfill, or used in low value applications. 
The United Kingdom's WRAP organisation is well aware of the problems facing glass recyclers worldwide. The material utilised is generally of no interest to the glass refineries. This process therefore provides an excellent cost benefit to agriculture, adds value to the recycling loop and reduces the amount of waste glass being disposed of to landfill. 
The material required is clean mixed waste glass in the range of 2-6 mm and we seek potential suppliers as well as potential joint venture partners for a UK based manufacturing operation.

Turkey plans to build two 4 reactor sites at Akkuyu and Sinop with further sites also being considered.,"The plans for Akkuyu power station are developing with agreements and a vendor in place and elements of construction underway. The Sinop site negotiations are ongoing. Akkuyu is being delivered by Rosatom and Sinop by a French-Japanese consortium. UKTI has been working closely with Turkish government and key stakeholders in increasing awareness of UK capabilities. 
Opportunities for the UK: The UK has capability across the whole fuel cycle, with every reactor currently available worldwide. The UK industry is technology neutral, and can act as an honest broker in advising new build countries on their choice of reactor.  This gives the UK the opportunity to support Turkey in all aspects of setting up their nuclear industry including education, regulation, consultancy, engineering, security, research and supply chain solutions.

"UKTI is working in partnership with industry, sector specialists and the British Embassy to promote opportunities for the UK supply chain.","Historically the NCS was relatively closed to foreign contractors. There are over 30bn boe of proven resources still in place (90 Bcf gas and 15bn barrels of oil), plus a further 18bn boe of probable resources yet to be discovered. Based on a top-down analysis the average NCS procurement spend is estimated to be around £13bn per annum over the next 10 years. Despite the lower oil price and industry-wide cost-cutting, exploration and production activity will remain robust over the medium term including in the more challenging areas of deep sea and the Norwegian Arctic.
Opportunities for UK companies include engineering and design; maintenance and modification; subsea equipment and components; enhanced oil recovery; and decommissioning services.  An increasing UK presence should also act as a spring board for the UK supply chain to participate in international projects.

Expansion of Hong Kong Airport from a two to a three runway system,"In the late 90’s, Hong Kong completed a replacement International airport on an island reclaimed from the sea. This has two runways and is operating near capacity which has led to additional terminal buildings and apron capacity being built between the runways. The practical maximum runway capacity of the existing two-runway system of Hong Kong International Airport (HKIA) is about 420,000 flight movements annually and it is estimated that the airport will reach its maximum capacity sometime between 2019 and 2022.  In 2011 the Airport Authority carried out a three-month consultation to gauge public opinion on HKIA's future development. Seventy-three percent of respondents supported the proposal to expand HKIA into a three-runway system to meet the airport's long-term growth demand. Under a three-runway system, HKIA will be able to accommodate 620,000 flight movements per year, meeting demand projections up to and possibly beyond 2030.
